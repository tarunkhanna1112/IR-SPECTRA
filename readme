THESE ARE THE FIRST SET OF CODES WRITTEN AS A PART OF MY PHD WHICH UTILISES THE WEALTH OF MOLECULAR MECHANICS PARAMETERISATION DATA WHICH CAN BE EXTRACTED FROM THE INFRARED SPECTRA OF A MOLECULE

THIS REPOSITORY CONTAIN: 
1. nmode_vis.tcl : TO VISUALISE THE NORMAL MODES CALCULATED THROUGH MOLECULAR MECHANICS FORCE FIELD. (FOR THIS YOU NEED TO HAVE NAB FUNCTIONALITY OF AMBER MOLECULAR MECHANICS PACKAGE AND GAUSS VIEW VISUALISATION PACKAGE)
2. force_constants_freq.tcl : TO DERIVE METAL PARAMETERS FROM GAUSSIAN FREQUENCY CALCULATIONS

3. IR.tcl : INTERFACE TO RUN THE ABOVE TWO CODES (LOOK IN THE FILE 'MAN' FOR THE SYNTAX)
